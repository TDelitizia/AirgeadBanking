### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was presented by a financial instituation to design and implement an investment calculator to be used by clients.
The program was to calculate two types of investments. One with additional monthly deposits by the client, and one without any 
additional deposits. The end user would be able to see a breakdown of balances as well as interest earned. It gave a visual as to how
the interest, as it compounded, affected their savings overall.

### What did you do particularly well?
I feel I was able to break down the design into pieces. Starting with the user inputs, functions for the calculations, and 
displaying the outputs clearly to the end user. 

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have definitely added some sort of coding to handle end user inputs that would be invalid, or not work with the 
calculations. For example, putting a reasonable cap on interest rates, or something that would prevent negative numbesr being entered
into the program. 

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
My difficulty with this one was the calculation for compounding interested with the monthly deposits. I did my best to rework them, 
but ultimately did reach out to a co-worker at my job for some assistance where I kept getting results that were not including the actual 
deposit made. That along with some YouTube videos eventually got me to where I needed to be. 

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This one really helped me read through the bugs and errors I had, more than any other project I have had in the past. I was able to work through
them, and see how sometimes solving one line fixed a few more on its own. I also really liked how this project, and the others, were given in 
the way of an actual "work order." I currently work in Product and Development, and I'm the one who is providing the "requirements" to our developers. 
It was interesting to see it from the other side, in receiving the request. It also brought to light how simple a request can be. In development, 
we just need to know what you want it to do, not the reasons why or the ultimate need of the client and how they will use it, just WHAT it needs to do. 

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I separated the program into fucntions, which made it easier for alterations in the future. Clear and consistent naming conventions, spacing, and additional
comments help make the code clear for any future updates to be done by another team.
